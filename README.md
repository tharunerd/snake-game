As a 2000s kid i was so mesmarised with the nokias snake game 
i have recreated it using basic OOPs concepts using python .
steps are as follows:
import turtle graphics
-> create a snake body.
-> make it move
-> control the snake
-> detect collision with wall, food and itself
-> score board maintainance
